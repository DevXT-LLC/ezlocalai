# Request Queue Configuration
# 
# This file documents the environment variables available for configuring
# the request queue system that handles concurrent chat completion requests.

# Maximum number of requests that can be processed simultaneously
# Default: 1 (sequential processing)
# Increase this value if you have sufficient GPU memory and want to process
# multiple requests in parallel. Be careful as this will increase memory usage.
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=1

# Maximum number of requests that can be queued waiting for processing
# Default: 100
# When this limit is reached, new requests will receive a 503 Service Unavailable error
MAX_QUEUE_SIZE=100

# Timeout for individual requests in seconds
# Default: 300 (5 minutes)
# After this time, requests will timeout with a 408 Request Timeout error
REQUEST_TIMEOUT=300

# Examples of different configurations:

# High-throughput configuration (requires substantial GPU memory):
# MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=3
# MAX_QUEUE_SIZE=50
# REQUEST_TIMEOUT=180

# Memory-constrained configuration:
# MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=1
# MAX_QUEUE_SIZE=200
# REQUEST_TIMEOUT=600

# Notes:
# - Higher MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS requires more GPU memory
# - Higher MAX_QUEUE_SIZE allows more requests to wait but uses more system memory
# - Lower REQUEST_TIMEOUT helps prevent resource leaks from stuck requests
# - Monitor queue status via the /v1/queue/status endpoint
