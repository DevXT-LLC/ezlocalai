# Request Queue Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

The original ezlocalai server would error when multiple chat completion requests were received simultaneously. This was due to the single global `pipe` object handling requests sequentially without proper queuing or concurrency management.

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a comprehensive request queuing system that:

1. **Queues incoming requests** when the system is at capacity
2. **Processes requests concurrently** (configurable)
3. **Handles timeouts** gracefully
4. **Provides status monitoring** via API endpoints
5. **Maintains compatibility** with existing streaming and non-streaming responses

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `RequestQueue.py` - Core queue implementation
- `queue-config.env.example` - Configuration example
- `QUEUE_SYSTEM.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- `test_queue.py` - Test suite for validation

### Modified Files:
- `app.py` - Integrated queue system into FastAPI endpoints

## Key Features

### 1. Configurable Concurrency
```env
MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=1  # How many requests to process simultaneously
MAX_QUEUE_SIZE=100         # How many requests can wait in queue
REQUEST_TIMEOUT=300        # Timeout in seconds for individual requests
```

### 2. Error Handling
- **503 Service Unavailable**: When queue is full
- **408 Request Timeout**: When requests exceed timeout
- **500 Internal Server Error**: When processing fails

### 3. Monitoring Endpoints
- `GET /v1/queue/status` - Overall queue metrics
- `GET /v1/queue/request/{request_id}` - Individual request status

### 4. Async Processing
- Fully async implementation using `asyncio`
- Non-blocking request queuing
- Graceful startup/shutdown

## Usage Examples

### Basic Configuration
```bash
# For single-GPU setups (recommended starting point)
export MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=1
export MAX_QUEUE_SIZE=50
export REQUEST_TIMEOUT=300
```

### High-Performance Configuration
```bash
# For systems with abundant GPU memory
export MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS=3
export MAX_QUEUE_SIZE=100
export REQUEST_TIMEOUT=180
```

### Client-Side Implementation
```python
import openai
import time

def chat_with_retry(client, messages, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = client.chat.completions.create(
                model="your-model",
                messages=messages
            )
            return response
        except openai.APIError as e:
            if e.status_code == 503 and attempt < max_retries - 1:
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
                continue
            raise
```

## Testing

Run the test suite to validate the implementation:
```bash
python test_queue.py
```

Expected output shows:
- ✓ Basic queue functionality
- ✓ Concurrent processing respecting limits
- ✓ Error handling for failures and queue overflow
- ✓ Timeout handling

## Performance Impact

### Memory Usage
- Minimal overhead for queue management
- Request objects are cleaned up after completion
- Configurable limits prevent memory exhaustion

### Processing Efficiency
- No change to model inference performance
- Concurrent processing can improve throughput (if GPU memory allows)
- Queue prevents resource conflicts

### Backwards Compatibility
- All existing API endpoints work unchanged
- Same request/response formats
- No client-side changes required

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Queue Status Example
```json
{
  "queue_size": 5,           // Requests waiting
  "processing_count": 1,     // Requests being processed
  "max_concurrent": 1,       // Configuration limit
  "max_queue_size": 100,     // Configuration limit
  "total_processed": 142,    // Success count
  "total_failed": 3,         // Error count
  "total_queued": 150,       // Total received
  "active_requests": 6,      // Currently tracked
  "is_running": true         // Queue processor status
}
```

### Log Analysis
Look for these log patterns:
- `[RequestQueue] Request {id} queued` - Request received
- `[RequestQueue] Processing request {id}` - Processing started
- `[RequestQueue] Request {id} completed` - Success
- `[RequestQueue] Request {id} failed` - Error

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy and Test**: Start with conservative settings
2. **Monitor Performance**: Use queue status endpoint
3. **Tune Configuration**: Adjust based on your hardware
4. **Implement Client Retries**: Handle 503 errors gracefully
5. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for patterns indicating needed adjustments

The queue system transforms ezlocalai from a single-request system to a robust, concurrent-capable AI server that can handle multiple clients efficiently.
